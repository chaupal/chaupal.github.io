      </header>
      <section>
        <p>For this tutorial, we will be developing with the:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://chaupal.github.io/releases.html">2.8.0 release</a>
            of JXSE or higher</li>
          <li><a href="http://chaupal.github.io/releases.html">1.1.0 release</a>
            of JP2P/Chaupal or higher</li>
        </ul>
        Both versions are currently still in an alpha stage, so some changes may
        occur. We will try to keep the documentation in par with these changes.
        <br>
        &nbsp;The bundles are available as as Eclipse update sites, so it has
        never been easier to run JXSE in OSGI. <br>
        <p>&nbsp;We will be working in the Plugin Perspective of the IDE.</p>
        <h2>Setting up</h2>
        <p>If you are new to Eclipse, then you can <a href="https://eclipse.org/downloads/">download
            </a>an Eclipse package and install it on your computer. In this
          tutorial, we will be developing with <a href="https://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-rcp-and-rap-developers/lunasr2">Eclipse
            for RCP and RAP Developers</a>. For development, the latest release
          ( currently Luna) should be good.</p>
        <p>Unzip the downloaded package to a location of your choosing (e.g.
          C:\Program Files\ Eclipse\Luna\Chaupal) and run (on Windows )
          eclipse.exe.&nbsp; The Eclipse IDE should open for you to work with.
          Follow the guidelines of the wizard and select a <em>workspace</em>
          on a location of your choosing. This is where you will be developing
          your projects. In a few minutes you should be up and running! You now
          have a bare-bones development environment to work with.<br>
          It is recommended to download the most recent updates for the IDE. For
          Windows<sup>TM</sup> users, you'll have to (re-) start the IDE with
          Administrator rights and select:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help -&gt; Check for Updates</p>
        <p>Run the wizard and restart Eclipse.</p>
        <p>In order to unleash Chaupal, you will need to add Chaupal
          functionality to your IDE. You can do this by adding the latest
          release of the Chaupal <a href="https://chaupal.github.io/releases/2.8.0/milestone/20141015/jxse-osgi/site.xml">jp2p-ui
            update site</a> to your IDE.&nbsp; Select <em>Window -&gt;
            Preferences -&gt; Install/Update</em> -<em>&gt; Available Software
            Sites</em> and then <em>'Add'</em> a '<em>New Site'</em>. Enter a
          general text (e.g Chaupal) and then include the URL to the most
          current release of jp2p-ui (e.g: <a href="https://chaupal.github.io/releases/jp2p-ui/1.1.0/20150516/site.xml">https://chaupal.github.io/releases/jp2p-ui/1.1.0/20150516/site.xml</a>)
          . Then press&nbsp; 'OK' to get back to the IDE. </p>
        <p>Next we need to install the bundles. Go to <em>Help -&gt; Install
            new software </em>and select <em>(work with)&nbsp; </em>the
          update site you just made. If all went well, you should be able to
          select the 'Chaupal JP2P' option. Select this and follow the
          guidelines of the wizard. Restart Eclipse and wait for the IDE to come
          up again.</p>
        <p>We are almost done! Create a new RCP plugin project by following the
          next steps:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Select File-&gt; New -&gt; Plugin Project</li>
          <li>Add the required data and select the "Eclipse Version" option
            (press Next)</li>
          <li>Select the "3.x Rich Client Application" option (press Finish) </li>
        </ul>
        Eclipse will now add a bare-bones RCP application to your workbench. You
        can run this application by selecting<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run -&gt; Debug As -&gt;
        Eclipse Application<br>
        <br>
        So far, this has all been standard Eclipse stuff. But we can start to
        make things more interesting by selecting the "Chaupal JP2P Container
        Perspective" to our RCP:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Window -&gt; Open Perspective
        -&gt; Other<br>
        <br>
        When you select this perspective, the User Interface will suddenly show
        all kinds of screens, which are currently mostly empty. <br>
        Congratulations! You are ready for Chaupal JP2P app development!<br>
        <br>
        Next we will be adding an<a href="http://chaupal.github.io/wiki/jxse-osgi2.html">
          existing JXTA application to the Chaupal container</a><br>
