        <h2>Creating a Simple Chaupal Project</h2>
        So far we have created an RCP project with the Chaupal JP2P project. Now
        we add a new plugin project in the same fashion as we did earlier:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File -&gt; New -&gt; Plugin
        Project<br>
        <br>
        When the wizard opens, we select an '<em>OSGI Framework</em>' project
        and follow the guidelines of the wizard until certain templates can be
        selected. Give the bundle a name, such as:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; org.&lt;your
        organisation&gt;.rdv<br>
        <br>
        where you fill in the organisation of your choosing.<br>
        In the list you can see two JXSE bundle options. Select the RDV option
        and press 'finish'. <br>
        We now have two bundles in our workspace. Time to see what this may
        achieve!<br>
        <br>
        In order to see the differences, we first need to make a few changes to
        the&nbsp; standard launch configuration. Open the launcher:<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run -&gt; Debug
        Configurations<br>
        <br>
        and select the 'Plugins' tab. Here you see a list of all the bundles
        that are activated when you run your application. By default, all the
        plugins and features are activated. For now, we respect this option, but
        we change the <em>launch with</em> option to run with the 'bundles
        selected below'. Then we set the 'auto-start' option of the new bundle
        to 'true'.&nbsp; Next we have to set the auto-start option to
        'true''&nbsp; for:<br>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>net.jxse.jetty</li>
          <li>net.jxse.netty</li>
          <li>net.jxse.osgi.platform</li>
        </ul>
        Include the following bundles to activate the console:<br>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>org.eclipse.equinox.console</li>
          <li>org.apache.felix.gogo.command</li>
          <li>org.apache.felix.gogo.runtime</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        We 'apply' the changes and run the launcher, but when the IDE opens,
        nothing has changed!<br>
        <br>
        We need to make one modification in the Activator class that was
        generated when the new bundle was created. Change the constructor as
        follows:<br>
        <code> </code><br>
        <pre class="code"><java class="java">public </java>Activator(){
 <span style="color: #7f0055;"> </span><java class="java">super</java>( S_PLUGIN_ID, DeveloperModes.DEBUG ) {
}
</pre> Last, we have to make some changes to the launch configuration we use to
        start the application. Open the launch configuration (run -&gt; Debug
        (or Run) Configurations -&gt; <br>
        <br>
        Eclipse makes a difference between the development environment and the
        target environment. The development environment can contain a lot of
        functionality like support for GIT, web development and database support
        that the applications you want to develop do not need. The <em>target
          environment </em>therefore usually contains a smaller and different
        set of functionality that the IDE requires. However, initially the
        target and development environment are configured to be the same.<br>
