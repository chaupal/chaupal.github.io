          If you are a seasoned OSGI developer, you may have noticed that the
          bundle project that was made, is <em>almost</em> identical to a
          regular OSGI bundle. The only changes to regular plugin-project is
          that:<br>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>The Activator derives from
              net.jp2p.chaupal.activator.Jp2pBundleActivator</li>
            <li>A JP2P-INF folder has been made with a jp2p-1.0.0.xml file in
              it.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These two features make a Chaupal JP2P project! Behind the scenes,
            the activator is busy checking the OSGI container for bundles that
            contain the resources that are defined in the jp2p XML file, and
            when it finds all the required resource, it creates a <em>jp2p
              container</em> that will hold these resources.</p>
          <p>If you are a seasoned JXTA developer, you may also notice that the
            project actually represents a JXTA<sup>TM</sup> <em>Rendezvous
              Service</em>.In Chaupal, the functionality provided by JXTA<sup>TM</sup><em>
            </em>is transformed in a format that the Chaupal JP2P container can
            understand (and parse). In fact, the Chaupal JP2P container is
            little more than a light-weight OSGI wrapper around the core JXTA<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;
            functionality. You may wonder why we decided to take this approach
            and not embed the JXTA<sup>TM</sup> classes in a more
            straightforward fashion. </p>
          <p>There are a number of reasons for doing so:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The Chaupal team was facing a licensing problem with the JXTA<sup>TM</sup>
              code, since Oracle bought SUN and support for JXTA<sup>TM</sup>
              was discontinued. By developing a new container in which JXTA<sup>TM</sup>
              could be 'plugged in', we were able to utilise the existing
              functionality, but still develop under an Apache 2.0 license.</li>
            <li>JXTA<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp; is, from a developer's perspective,
              basically less a matter of programming and more one of configuring
              a peer-to-peer node. Most developers will use very comparable
              configurations, and only start their programming when messages are
              relayed throughout the network. By using XML, this practice is
              enforced.</li>
            <li>From a configuration perspective, the NetworkManager and
              NetworkConfigurator classes are not really different than, say a
              PeerGroup or a DiscoveryService. The Chaupal container considers
              all these to be JP2P services,, which allows for a more versatile
              manner of configuring your P2P network </li>
            <li>The JXTA<sup>TM</sup>specifications were made prior to the rise
              of social media and new connection structures, such as web
              sockets. The Chaupal container is more extensible, because it uses
              the highly modular approach of OSGI.</li>
          </ol>
          In order to get a feel for the Chaupal approach, open the
          jp2p-1.0.0.xml file in an editor. Eclipse has a very good editor
          hidden in the <em>Web, XML, JavaEE and OSGI Enterpise </em>section
          of the Luna update site, so you may want to install this software
          first:<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
          <ul>
            <li>&nbsp;Help -&gt; Install new software</li>
            <li>Select the&nbsp; 'Luna' repository&nbsp;&nbsp;and choose the <em>Eclipse
                Editors and Tools</em> from the section mentioned above</li>
          </ul>
          Restart Eclipse and open the XML file with the provided XML Editor:<br>
          <br>
          <pre class="xml-code">&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt;
&lt;jp2p-container id="org.chaupal.rdv" name="RDV" auto-start="true"&gt;
  &lt;properties&gt;
    &lt;home-folder&gt;${user.home}/.jxta/${bundle-id}&lt;/home-folder&gt;
  &lt;/properties&gt;
  &lt;persistence-service context="chaupal"/&gt;
  &lt;network-manager clear-config="true"&gt;
    &lt;properties&gt;
      &lt;config-mode&gt;RENDEZVOUS&lt;/config-mode&gt;
      &lt;peer-id create="true" persist="true"/&gt;
    &lt;/properties&gt;
    &lt;network-configurator&gt;
       &lt;properties&gt;&lt;/properties&gt;
       &lt;tcp&gt;
         &lt;properties&gt;    
            &lt;port&gt;9715&lt;/port&gt;
            &lt;incoming-status&gt;true&lt;/incoming-status&gt;
            &lt;outgoing-status&gt;true&lt;/outgoing-status&gt;
         &lt;/properties&gt;
       &lt;/tcp&gt;
       &lt;http&gt;
         &lt;properties&gt;    
            &lt;port&gt;8081&lt;/port&gt;
            &lt;incoming-status&gt;true&lt;/incoming-status&gt;
            &lt;outgoing-status&gt;true&lt;/outgoing-status&gt;
         &lt;/properties&gt;    
       &lt;/http&gt;
       &lt;multicast enabled="true"/&gt;
    &lt;/network-configurator&gt;
  &lt;/network-manager&gt;
&lt;/jp2p-container&gt;
</pre>
          <p>JXTA developers will immediately see the familiar outlines of a
            very common Rendezvous configuration. In fact, it is one of the
            first examples which is presented in the book <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/47538921/Practical-JXTA-II#scribd">Practical
              JXTA II</a> by Jérôme Verstrynge. However, with a few
            modifications! Let's examine the code above a bit closer:<br>
          </p>
          <pre class="xml-code">&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt;
&lt;jp2p-container id="org.chaupal.rdv" name="RDV" auto-start="true"&gt;
  &lt;properties&gt;
    &lt;home-folder&gt;${user.home}/.jxta/${bundle-id}&lt;/home-folder&gt;
  &lt;/properties&gt;
  &lt;persistence-service context="chaupal"/&gt;
&lt;/jp2p-container&gt;
</pre>The first few lines of the jp2p file (you can actually run this without
          problems, try it!) has no relationships with any&nbsp; JXTA<sup>TM </sup>code
          whatsoever. The code tells the system to:<br>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Create a JP2P container</li>
            <li>'Auto start' it, so that the services are activated when they
              are parsed successfully</li>
            <li>Use a folder called ".jxta/org.chaupal.rdv" in the user section
              of your computer's operating system</li>
            <li>Persist properties using a service of context 'chaupal', which
              basically means that the OSGI preferences are used.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It may be clear that JXTA<sup>TM</sup>s NetworkConfigurator will
            use this location, so it is no longer available there. Instead,
            Chaupal takes care that the load and save configuration of the
            NetworkConfigurator use the locations provided by the configuration
            file. The other settings are rather straightforward for JXTA<sup>TM</sup>developers.
            If you are new to JXTA<sup>TM</sup>, you can read the section "Jack
            the Rendezvous peer" in <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/47538921/Practical-JXTA-II#scribd">Jérôme
              Verstrynge's book</a>. You will see that the JP2P configuration
            file is a representation of the settings that are coded there.</p>
