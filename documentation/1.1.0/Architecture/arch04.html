            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        Every factory is responsible for a single JP2P component. In fact, one
        could say that the JP2P XML file represents the factories that are
        needed, rather than the components. When a JP2P project is launched, the
        builder:<br>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>parses the jp2p-1.0.0.xml file globally to see if all the required
            factories are available</li>
          <li>parses the file in more detail, in order to fill the factories
            with the required data</li>
          <li>completes the builder with factories that are needed by others</li>
          <li>Runs the factories in order to build the JP2P container. &nbsp; </li>
        </ol>
        If a container is not built, it usually means that a builder is not
        registered as a declarative service. You will see this in the console,
        through a message that complains that the builder is waiting for a
        certain factory (e.g: NetworkManagerFactory if the JXTA <sup>TM </sup>platform
        bundle is not activated). <br>
        <br>
        A factory not only creates a corresponding JP2P component, but it
        actually starts by creating a <em>property source</em>. The property
        source actually contains the values that are depicted in the XML file,
        and come in two flavours:<br>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>net.jp2p.container.properties.IJp2pDirectives (the XML attributes)</li>
          <li>net.jp2p.container.properties.IJp2pProperties (XML properties)</li>
        </ol>
        &nbsp;Although the distinction between these is not rigid, one could say
        that, in general, a directive provides information for the factory,
        while the properties&nbsp; are needed to configure the JP2P component.
        If we look at the configuration file we made in the previous section:<br>
        <br>
        <pre class="xml-code">&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt;
&lt;jp2p-container id="org.chaupal.rdv" name="RDV" auto-start="true"&gt;
  &lt;properties&gt;
    &lt;home-folder&gt;${user.home}/.jxta/${bundle-id}&lt;/home-folder&gt;
  &lt;/properties&gt;
  &lt;persistence-service context="chaupal"/&gt;
&lt;/jp2p-container&gt;
</pre>we can see that the builder gets a <em>directive&nbsp; </em>to
        auto-start the container, and that one of the properties of the
        container itself is the location of the home folder.<br>
        <br>
        <h3><span style="color: black;">2.4.1: The Build Sequence of a JP2P
            Component Factory</span></h3>
        When the builder is ready to run a factory, it follows a certain
        procedure:<br>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>It creates the property source and adds it to a tree of property
            sources</li>
          <li>it adds property sources that are needed to successfully build a
            component</li>
          <li>When the tree of property sources is complete, it starts to build
            the components</li>
          <li>Depending on the type and the provided directives, the services
            are started</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The build process of the components does not follow the tree
          structure of the property sources. Instead, every factory is notified
          of the various states that other factories are in, and they can
          proceed when the correct conditions are met. For instance, the <strong>net.jp2p.chaupal.jxta.platform;NetworkManagerFactory
            </strong>should not start if the <strong>net.jp2p.chaupal.jxta.platform.configurator.NetworkConfiguratorFactory</strong>
          is not ready. Therefore the construction of the <strong>NetworkManager</strong>
          component is delayed until all the configuration properties have been
          set.</p>
        <p> The builder therefore dispatches a number of <strong>net.jp2p.container.builder.ICompositeBuilderListener.BuilderEvents</strong>
          to all the factories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>PROPERTY_SOURCE_PREPARED</li>
          <li>PROPERTY_SOURCE_CREATED</li>
          <li>COMPONENT_PREPARED</li>
          <li>COMPONENT_CREATED</li>
          <li>COMPONENT_STARTED</li>
          <li>FACTORY_COMPLETED</li>
        </ul>
        There are two types of factories, which implement a corresponding
        interface:<br>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>net.jp2p.container.factory.IPropertySourceFactory</strong></li>
          <li><strong>net.jp2p.container.factory.IComponentFactory</strong></li>
        </ul>
        Obviously the latter is derived from the former. As may be expected, a
        propertysource factory does not create a JP2P component, but just
        properties. The <strong>net.jp2p.container.startup.StartupServiceFactory</strong>
        is a good example of this type of factory, as it little more than follow
        the <strong>BuilderEvents</strong>, and start a service if these happen
        to be created. The <strong>net.jp2p.container.log.LoggerFactory</strong>
        is another fine example, as it displays information on the build
        process, and is no longer needed once the container is complete.<br>
        A special type of propertysource factories have been implemented for <strong>net.jp2p.chaupal.jxta.platform.configurator.NetworkConfiguratorFactory.
          </strong>If we take a closer look at the jp2p-1.0.0.xml file:<br>
        <br>
        <pre class="xml-code">&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt;
&lt;jp2p-container id="org.chaupal.rdv" name="RDV" auto-start="true"&gt;
  ...
    &lt;network-configurator&gt;
       &lt;properties&gt;&lt;/properties&gt;
       &lt;tcp&gt;
         &lt;properties&gt;    
            &lt;port&gt;9715&lt;/port&gt;
            &lt;incoming-status&gt;true&lt;/incoming-status&gt;
            &lt;outgoing-status&gt;true&lt;/outgoing-status&gt;
         &lt;/properties&gt;
       &lt;/tcp&gt;
       &lt;http&gt;
         &lt;properties&gt;    
            &lt;port&gt;8081&lt;/port&gt;
            &lt;incoming-status&gt;true&lt;/incoming-status&gt;
            &lt;outgoing-status&gt;true&lt;/outgoing-status&gt;
         &lt;/properties&gt;    
       &lt;/http&gt;
       &lt;multicast enabled="true"/&gt;
    &lt;/network-configurator&gt;
  ...
&lt;/jp2p-container&gt;
</pre> we see that the properties of the NetworkConfigurator have been grouped
        together in logical units, such as http&nbsp; tcp, multicast and so on.
        Internally, the&nbsp; <strong>NetworkConfiguratorFactory </strong>is
        completed by a&nbsp; number of property source factories that complete
        the platform settings. <br>
        <br>
        A property source factory implements the <strong>net.jp2p.container.builder.ICompositeBuilderListener
          </strong>interface, which contains one method:<br>
        <br>
        <strong>public void</strong> notifyChange(
        ComponentBuilderEvent&lt;T&gt; event );<br>
        <br>
        Every factory must override this method in order to determine when a
        next state of the factory should start.<br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        The component factories provide a <strong>getComponent() </strong>method
        that is used to fill the container. After the build process has
        completed, only these components are therefore available in the
        container, as the factories and builders are cleaned up and removed from
        the VM. <br>
        <br>
        A consequences of this approach is that a lot of services can be
        positioned anywhere in the XML file; <br>
        <br>
        <pre class="xml-code">&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt;
&lt;jp2p-container id="org.chaupal.rdv" name="RDV" auto-start="true"&gt;
  &lt;network-manager clear-config="true"&gt;
    &lt;network-configurator&gt;
       &lt;tcp&gt;...&lt;/tcp&gt;
       &lt;http&gt;...&lt;/http&gt;
       &lt;multicast enabled="true"/&gt;
    &lt;/network-configurator&gt;
  &lt;/network-manager&gt;
&lt;/jp2p-container&gt;
</pre>
        <p>The parent-child structure of the above XML file is more a matter of
          convention than that the parser requires this; as long as the
          factories start the creation of JP2P components at the correct moment,
          the container should be built in the cortrect fashion. The structure <em>does</em>
          have consequences for the way the components are stored in the
          container (and displayed in the UI). As a result, a JP2P container
          tends to be flatter than than the corresponding JXTA<sup>TM</sup>
          application.</p>
