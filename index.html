<p>Chaupal is a Hindi word. It means a <em>common meeting place in a village
owned by the whole community</em>. This truly reflects the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) philosophy.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JXTA">JXTA</a> is a programming
language and platform independent Open Source protocol started by Sun
Microsystems for P2P networking in 2001.</p>

<p>You can use JXTA technology to create P2P applications based
on Java technology. The JXTA technology is a set of open protocols that enable
any connected device on the network, ranging from cell phones and wireless PDAs
to PCs and servers, to communicate and collaborate in a P2P manner. JXTA peers
create a virtual network where any peer can interact with other peers and
resources directly, even when some of the peers and resources are behind
firewalls and network address translations (NATs) or on different network
transports.</p>

<p>The Chaupal Organisation was founded by former members of the JXTA community,
with a strong commitment to the true open source spirit. We intend to continue
the development and maintenance of the JXTA protocols and their
implementation for Java (JXSE), and also to define new P2P protocols, based on
experience acquired on the JXTA project. These protocols will first be developed
for JVM languages, but other implementations are welcome.</p>

<p>JXTA was initially developed by Sun Microsystems, as an Open Source project
under a custom license. Over time, Sun's involvement reduced, with the community
continuing work, overseen by a board that included Sun staff. The community
sought to change the license to the Apache License 2.0, with requests made to
Oracle representatives - with no response. Development of JXTA paused after
the 2.7 release, around the time of Oracle purchasing Sun Microsystems. In
January 2011, the project lead at the time, J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Verstrynge, <a
href="https://java.net/nonav/projects/jxta/lists/dev/archive/2011-01/message/2">stepped
down</a>, with no board elected to carry the project forward.</p>

<p>In August 2013, <a href="http://www.condast.com/condast/">Kees Pieters</a>
started a series of articles on DZone (<a
href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/jxse-and-equinox-tutorial-part">Part
One</a>, <a
href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/jxse-and-equinox-tutorial-part-0">Part
Two</a>) on JXSE and Equinox, which revived enthusiasm in the JXTA community. <a
href="http://devzendo.org">Matt Gumbley</a> had been looking at JXTA for some
open source projects, and contacted Kees to discuss attempting to revive it. In
October, <a
href="https://java.net/nonav/projects/jxta/lists/announce/archive/2013-10/message/0">they
consulted the JXTA-announce mailing list</a>, issued <a href="Roadmap.pdf">a
proposal</a> [PDF] and <a
href="https://java.net/nonav/projects/jxta/lists/announce/archive/2013-10/message/10">offered
to take over maintenance of JXSE</a> for the 2.8x releases, and to revive the
Chaupal project envisaged by J&eacute;r&ocirc;me. The subversion repository for 
JXSE has been migrated to GitHub, and work on 2.8x has started, merging
changes and enhancements that had been made on the 2.6x branch, and from
other users.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/chaupal/jxse">JXSE</a> is still governed by
<a href="jxta-license.txt">the JXTA license</a>,
which cannot be changed. New code by Chaupal that extends/modifies JXSE is
governed by the Apache License, version 2.0, and must be committed to the 
<a href="https://github.com/chaupal/jp2p">JP2P</a> GitHub repository.</p>
