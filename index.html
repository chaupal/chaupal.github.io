        <h3>Welcome to Chaupal</h3>
        <p>Chaupal is a Hindi word. It means a <em>common meeting place in a
            village owned by the whole community</em>. This truly reflects the
          Peer-to-Peer (P2P) philosophy.</p>
        <h3>About JXTA...</h3>
        <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JXTA">JXTA</a> is a programming
          language and platform-independent Open Source protocol started by Sun
          Microsystems for P2P networking in 2001.</p>
        <p>You can use JXTA technology to create P2P applications in Java or on
          other JVM languages. JXTA is a set of open protocols that enable any
          connected device on the network, ranging from cell phones and wireless
          PDAs to PCs and servers, to communicate and collaborate in a P2P
          manner. JXTA peers create a virtual network where any peer can
          interact with other peers and resources directly, even when some of
          the peers and resources are behind firewalls and network address
          translations (NATs) or on different network transports.</p>
        <h3>About The Chaupal Organisation...</h3>
        <p>The Chaupal Organisation was founded by former members of the JXTA
          community, with a strong commitment to the true open source spirit. We
          intend to continue the development and maintenance of the JXTA
          protocols and their implementation for Java (JXSE), and also to define
          new P2P protocols, based on experience acquired on the JXTA project.
          These protocols will first be developed for JVM languages, but other
          implementations are welcome.</p>
        <p>JXTA was initially developed by Sun Microsystems, as an Open Source
          project under a custom license. Over time, Sun's involvement reduced,
          with the community continuing work, overseen by a board that included
          Sun staff. The community sought to change the license to the Apache
          License 2.0, with requests made to Oracle representatives - with no
          response. Development of JXTA paused after the 2.7 release, around the
          time of Oracle purchasing Sun Microsystems. In January 2011, the
          project lead at the time, Jérôme Verstrynge, <a href="https://java.net/nonav/projects/jxta/lists/dev/archive/2011-01/message/2">stepped
            down</a>, with no board elected to carry the project forward.</p>
        <p>In August 2013, <a href="http://www.condast.com/condast/">Kees
            Pieters</a> started a series of articles on DZone (<a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/jxse-and-equinox-tutorial-part">Part
            One</a>, <a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/jxse-and-equinox-tutorial-part-0">Part
            Two</a>) on JXSE and Equinox, which revived enthusiasm in the JXTA
          community. <a href="http://devzendo.org">Matt Gumbley</a> had been
          looking at JXTA for some open source projects, and contacted Kees to
          discuss attempting to revive it. In October, <a href="https://java.net/nonav/projects/jxta/lists/announce/archive/2013-10/message/0">they
consulted
            the JXTA-announce mailing list</a>, issued <a href="Roadmap.pdf">a
            proposal</a> [PDF] and <a href="https://java.net/nonav/projects/jxta/lists/announce/archive/2013-10/message/10">offered
to
            take over maintenance of JXSE</a> for possible 2.8x releases, and to
          revive the Chaupal project envisaged by <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/ChaupalProposal">Jérôme's
            Apache Proposal</a>. The subversion repository for JXSE has been
          migrated to GitHub, and work on 2.8x has started, merging changes and
          enhancements that had been made on the 2.6x branch, and from other
          users.</p>
